![Website Tesla Clone Preview](assets/image/readme/model-3-preview.png)

This website is a website made based on the official Tesla website at www.tesla.com, where in this project, I will make the Tesla website as similar as possible to the original website and use all my skills in the field of Web Development.

In this project i learn a lot thing, besides i can refresh again my memory about HTML and CSS, i also learned my things about DOM usage and Event Handler in Javascript. Beside that, i also learned about Clean Code Implementation Javascript and new property from CSS, is called snap-scrolling. from this webiste also thought me the inportance of planning what i will do so that flow development will be clearly directed.

This is the first project website clone and this project will be continued to create other clone popular webiste. Maybe as I continue to learn and work, I will make a website that is neater and with a clear structure.

    For create fade effect on text and button, we should get wrapper of all them that is main section, and we can use web API method called getBoundingClientRect() to get the x position of main section, create offset value you want (the greater the offset value, the longer the fade effect will be given) and calculate them with browser viewport to get opacity value that will be given every we scroll to main section. Besides that, you can use this effect for change title of every cars with same method like you get the opacity value. to know more about getBoundingClientRect() method you can [click this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect)
